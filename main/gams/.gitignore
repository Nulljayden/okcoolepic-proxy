# This script changes the current working directory to the roms directory
# located in the gfiles/rarch/roms/ path.

# First, we use the 'cd' command to change the current directory to the
# desired path. The 'if' statement checks if the directory change was
# successful by testing the return value of the 'cd' command (which is
# 0 if the change was successful, and non-zero otherwise).

# If the directory change was successful, the script prints a success
# message to the console.

  echo "Successfully changed to the roms directory."
# If the directory change was not successful, the script prints an error
# message to the console.
